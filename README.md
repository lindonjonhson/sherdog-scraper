# Sherdog-scraper
Webscrapping tool created using Python to retrieve fighter data from Sherdog.

##   Description

Bellator is one of the largest MMA organizations in the world but since it does not have their own statistics open to the public, Sherdog is the go-to website if you want to get fighter's data.

With that in mind, I created this script that will scrape a fighter profile and retrieve all the important information from it and if you need it, export it as a CSV file.

Feel free to use it!

**Obs:** Depending on the fighter profile, you might need to make a feel changes to the code.
